# Fork information  

- ADD automatic url detection with an option (requires tabs permission and requires permission to access all urls)  
- ADD prepend/append option  
- FORMAT files and add semicolons (sorry, I had to do it.)  
There could be more that I forgot.  

I am very willing to send a push request to update kmltml/clipboard-inserter but with this many changes I'm not sure what the creator would think about that.  
Let me know.

# Clipboard Inserter

A simple addon whose purpose is to automatically insert contents of clipboard into the page.

If you're looking to install this addon, it's available here:

 - [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/clipboard-inserter/)
 - [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clipboard-inserter/deahejllghicakhplliloeheabddjajm)

Or, if the links don't work, just search for "clipboard inserter" in the appropriate addon market.

On Chrome, if you want to use this extension with local files (the `file://` protocol), you have to enable the "Allow access to file URLs" setting in the extension details.
